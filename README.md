# PlaywrightExample
This is an example of a Playwright BDD test framework project, tesitng both APIs and GUIs.

# Example website
https://www.saucedemo.com/ for GUI testing.
https://reqres.in for API testing.

# Reasons for doing things the way I did them.
POM model is superior for maintainability. Plus it follows good coding practices for abstracting things out into their separate locations.
Using testIds (aka "data-*" Ids) is superior to using xpaths because xpaths could change, but the test Id should be stable.
Using .env files is a good way to hide sensitive data from your repo. Repos should NOT have sensitive information pushed to them.
BDD was requested of me at work, so I experimented with it posted it here as a demo solution (no work code, just examples).
API testing is a "must have" in most environments, so I include it here, with minimal extra libraries. Thanks for already having a context Playwright!
According to Stack Overflow, you need to have all the processing of requests in the same file, otherwise the response will be disposed.
If I can find a way to NOT do that, then I will refactor.
Any generated file MUST go into the .gitignore because its standard practice to not commit generated files.


# To setup this project for yourself.
Clone or pull down the zip archive, and unzip it.
Open the root directory in VS Code. Create a new terminal.
Run the following commands:
```
npm install
```
Now, you $hould have all the modules/libraries installed.

# Run test commands
To test the GUI, run the following commands:
```
npm test
pnpm test
pnpm tagged-test "@login-gui"
```
NPM, NPX, or PNPM, whatever you have.

To test the API, run the following commands (TBD):
```
pnpm tagged-test "@login-api"
```

# How I set this up (for future me or you)
```
npm init playwright@latest
npm install @playwright/test
npm install dotenv -D
npm install playwright -D
npm install playwright-bdd -D
npm install winston -D
npm install node-fetch -D 
```
With selection options for (npm init playwright@latest):
-   Typescript
-   "test-scenarios" as test folder
-   No Git (setup later)
-   Yes, Install playwright browsers.

Copy created project into a repo that you already created on Github or your prefered storage site.
Added folders to organize your project.
Visited "https://playwright.dev/docs/pom" for POM page example.
Visited "https://github.com/apatelia/playwright-with-bdd/blob/main/step-definitions/login.steps.ts" as an example project for getting BDD functionality working right.
